# cx_timer
for measuring and keeping records of contractions.

USAGE:

In a terminal, run this:

```
python cx_timer.py
```

You should press the enter key when prompted to record:

* beginning of contraction
* end of contraction

You may type other messages to:

* finish recording contractions in one period
* move on to next cycle if enter key pressed erroneously.

hopefully upcoming updates:

* comparative analysis of contraction episodes
* warning message when it looks like real labor!!
